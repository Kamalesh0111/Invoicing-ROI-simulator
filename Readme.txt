Project Title: Invoice ROI Genie

1. Project Overview
We'll build a simple web app called Invoice ROI Genie. It will calculate the cost savings for businesses that switch to automated invoicing. Users can input their data, see the results instantly, save their calculations as "scenarios," and download a report after providing an email.

2. Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Express.js
Database: Supabase
Hosting: Vercel (frontend) & Render (backend)

3. Project Breakdown
Backend (Express.js)
The backend will handle all the business logic and data storage. We'll create an Express server with a few key API endpoints:
->Takes user inputs and returns calculated savings without saving.
->Allows saving, viewing, and deleting scenarios from the database.
->Captures a user's email and provides a simple HTML report for download.
This server will connect to a Supabase database to store all the saved scenario data.

Frontend (React):
The frontend is the user-facing interface. We'll build a single-page application using React components:
->An input form for users to enter their business metrics.
->A results section to instantly display the calculated savings, ROI, and payback period.
->A scenario manager to list, load, and delete saved calculations.
->A modal to capture an email before allowing a report download.
->The frontend will communicate with our backend API to perform calculations and manage data.

4. Deployment & Documentation
Hosting: The Express backend will be deployed on Render, and the React frontend will be deployed on Vercel.
README File: A final README.md file will be created. It will include instructions on how to run the project locally and a brief guide to the API endpoints.
